            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                At CCAV, we are dedicated to fostering a strong foundation on the word of God and building a supportive,
                loving community for all. Our mission is to seek God and His will in all that we do, following His
                guidance according to the Scriptures. We strive to create an environment where individuals can grow in
                their faith, connect with others, and find a sense of belonging. We aim to be a beacon of hope and
                encouragement, providing spiritual guidance and support to those in need. Through our various
                ministries, services, and outreach programs, we endeavor to make a positive impact on our congregation
                and the wider community. Join us as we journey together in faith, love, and service, always seeking to
                align our lives with God's will and His word.
